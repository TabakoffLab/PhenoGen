<H3>UCSC Genome Browser Image</H3>
The image displayed below is generated by the UCSC Genome Browser with a mix of data aggregated from PhenoGen, UCSC Genome Browser, and Ensembl.<BR /><BR />
Here is a quick primer if you are unfamiliar with the UCSC Genome Browser ?????.
<BR /><BR />
You may add tracks using the controls below.  All of the tracks are color coded based on their source and track or on the data itself.  Please see detailed descriptions of each track below or the legend for further details on the color coding and data contained in each track.
<BR />

</div></div>


<div id="HelpUCSCImageControlContent" class="inpageHelpContent" title="Help-Image Controls"><div class="help-content">
<H3>UCSC Image Controls</H3>
The controls in this section determine what information is included in the image above and tables below.
<BR /><BR />
Each track includes information about it.  Hold your mouse over the <img src="<%=imagesDir%>icons/info.gif"> icon to display additional information.
<BR /><BR />
Check the box next to the track you would like to include in the image.  The image should then be generated and appear shortly.  For some tracks, you may control the way the track is displayed.  You can change this by selecting the option next to the track.(ex.
             <select name="example" id="example">
            	<option value="1" selected="selected">Dense</option>
                <option value="3" >Pack</option>
                <option value="2" >Full</option>
            </select> )
<BR /><BR />
Dense-This is the most compressed view.  Generally with no labels for features and all features compressed into a single line of the display. <BR />
Pack-Fits features in as there is room for both the label and feature.  This saves vertical space over the full view.  <BR />
Full-Each entry in the track has a dedicated line of the display.  The label for each entry can be found at the far left.  Entries will be order from top to bottom in order of their occurence from left to right.
<BR /><BR />
The best option depends on what you are looking for so try them and find what will work for you.

<div id="HelpeQTLContent" class="inpageHelpContent" title="Help-eQTLs"><div class="help-content">
<H3>eQTLs</H3>
The eQTL columns provide a general idea of where a gene, in the region you have entered, is controlled from.  Currently, <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTLs</a> are currently only available at the gene (transcript cluster) level instead of the probe set level, which means the first columns give you information about the transcript cluster.  <BR /><BR />

Columns:<BR />
	Transcript Cluster ID- The unique ID assigned by Affymetrix.  <BR />
	Location-The chromosomes and base-pair coordinates where the gene is located. <BR />
	Annotation level- Related to the confidence in the gene.  Core is the highest confidence.  This level tends to correspond very closely with the Ensembl gene annotation. Extended is lower confidence and may include additional regions outside of the Ensembl annotated exons.  Full is even lower confidence and includes additional regions beyond the Ensembl annotations.<BR />
	Genome Wide Associations- A way to view all the locations with a P-value below the cutoff selected.  Circos is used to create a plot of each region in each tissue associated with expression of the gene selected.<BR />
<BR />
Tissue Columns<BR />
	These columns summarize the data for each tissue.<BR />
	Total # of locations with a P-value < (Selected Cutoff)- The number of locations associated with expression below a cutoff selected in the Filter List section above the table.<BR />
	Minimum P-Value Location- The P-value and location of the minimum P-Value for the given tissue.  P-Value is in black, above the location in blue.  Click the location to open a Detailed Transcription Information window for that location.<BR />

<div id="HelpbQTLInRegionContent" class="inpageHelpContent" title="Help-bQTL Tab"><div class="help-content">
<H3><a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#bQTLs" target="_blank">bQTL</a> Tab</H3>
	The <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#bQTLs" target="_blank">bQTL</a> tab allows you to view <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#bQTLs" target="_blank">bQTLs</a> that overlap with the region.  <BR /><BR />
What is a bQTL?(<a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#bQTLs" target="_blank">View detailed bQTL information</a>) 
	A Behavioral Quantitative Trait Loci or bQTL is a region that is associated with a particular phenotype or behavior (thus <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#bQTLs" target="_blank">bQTL</a>).  <BR /><BR />
How is it calculated?
	<a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#bQTLs" target="_blank">bQTLs</a> can be found for Recombinant Inbred Panels by measuring a trait/behavior across strains in the panel and then correlating the values to the genotype of each strain between markers.  Based on that correlation regions can be found that are correlated with a particular phenotype.  These are the regions listed in the table under this tab.  They may indicate that a gene or other feature is somehow influencing the phenotype.

</div></div>


<div id="HelpeQTLTabContent" class="inpageHelpContent" title="Help"><div class="help-content">
<H3>eQTL Tab</H3>
This tab shows the genes that might be controlled by a feature in the choosen region.  There is at least an <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTL</a> with a P-value below the cutoff in the highlighted(Blue) for the selected region in one or more tissues.  However, the actual region may just overlap with the current region, so the <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTL</a> region associated with the P-value may be a different than the current region. 
<BR />
The Circos plot shows where the genes with <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTLs</a> in this region are physically located.  
<BR />
The table below the Circos plot lists all the genes and <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTLs</a> for each gene in each tissue.  Use the View Location Plot link to view all the <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTLs</a> for a gene in a Circos plot that shows each <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTL</a> for the selected gene.
<BR />
Finally, to view detailed transcript and probe set data, click on a Gene Symbol to display a summary specific to that gene.
<BR /><BR />
What is an eQTL? (<a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">View detailed eQTL information</a>)   
An eQTL is a region that is correlated across recombinant inbred strains to expression of a gene(or in the case of our Affy data displayed, Transcript Cluster) or probeset.  This may indicate some feature in this region is influencing expression of the gene with a significant <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTL</a> in the region.
<BR /><BR />
How is it calculated? 
<a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTLs</a> can be found for Recombinant Inbred Panels by measuring expression across strains in the panel and then correlating the values to the genotype of each strain between markers.  Based on that correlation, regions can be found that are correlated with expression.   In the table, the region overlaps with one of the regions that is assigned a P-value below the cutoff you selected.  This may indicate that a gene or other feature in this region, or one of the other regions with a significant P-value, is somehow influencing the expression of the gene.
<BR /><BR />
What does an <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTL</a> for a transcript cluster mean? 
At the transcript cluster level, this is an <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTL</a> for a gene and not individual probe sets.  For now, this is the only level available.

<div id="HelpRevCircosContent" class="inpageHelpContent" title="Help-Circos eQTL Plot"><div class="help-content">
<H3>Circos Plot eQTL Gene Locations</H3>
This plot shows all of the genes that have an <a href="<%=commonDir%>definitions.jsp#eQTLs" target="_blank">eQTL</a> in the region entered.  These genes correspond to the genes listed in the table below.  If a higher number of genes are located in nearly the same region only the first 2-3 may be displayed.
<BR /><BR />
The plot can be hidden using the +/- button.  The size of the plot can also be controlled using the Adjust Vertical Viewable Size dropdown list.
<BR /><BR />
When your mouse is inside the border below, you can zoom in/out on the plot.  When your mouse is outside the border you can scroll normally.  The controls inside the image can be used to zoom in and out and reset the image.  You can also click-and-drag to reposition the image.

<H3>DAVID</H3>
A list of genes can be imported into the <a href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/" target="_blank">DAVID website</a> for additional information about function and also to look for a significant enrichment in pathways, which might imply some biological meaning.  The link, when available, will open the summany page where you can explore the different DAVID tools.
<BR /><BR />
Currently only lists of 300 genes are less are supported.  This is a limit of the method used to submit genes to the DAVID website.  We will either be replacing the site or supporting a different method to allow longer lists.  If you perform filtering to get the list below 300 you will be able to click a link and immediately analyze data on the site, Otherwise you can copy one of the ID columns such as Gene IDs(Ensembl IDs) and submit them on your own.
