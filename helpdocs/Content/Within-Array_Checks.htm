        <h1 class="pgBrkBefore"><a name="kanchor40"></a>Within-Array Checks for Affymetrix 3' Arrays</h1>
        <p>The within-array quality control checks are examined using the Bioconductor 
 package <span style="font-style: italic;">Simpleaffy</span>. There are 
 four checks that are examined:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet" value="1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Average_Background"></a>Average Background</span> &#160;Average 
 background is examined to determine if it is consistent across arrays. 
 Affymetrix has indicated that typical background averages range from 20 
 to 100, but there is no statistically relevant range for these values 
 to fall within.</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="2"><a name="Internal_Controls"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Internal Controls</span> &#160;There 
 are two internal house-keeping genes ( β-actin and GAPDH) that are 
 used to evaluate the RNA and assay quality. Three probe sets have been 
 designed per control. The first probe set measures the intensity of the 
 3' end of the gene, the second probe set measures the intensity of the 
 5’ end of the gene, and the third probe set measures the intensity in 
 the middle of the gene. The ratio of the intensity from the 3' end to 
 the 5' end should theoretically be around 1. According to Wilson, et al. 
 (2004), ratios above 1.25 for GAPDH should be considered outliers and 
 ratios over 3 for β-actin should be considered outliers.</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="3"><a name="Percent_Present"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Percent Present</span> &#160;Affymetrix 
 recommends the use of a normalization and summary method called Microarray 
 Suite 5.0 (MAS5). Within this normalization procedure, each probe set 
 gives a Present, Marginal, or Absent call. The percent of present probe 
 sets out of all probe sets on the array is used as a quality control measure. 
 Although the percent of present probe sets measured is highly dependent 
 on each specific experiment with respect to the number of genes you expect 
 to be expressed, an extremely low value raises suspicion about the quality 
 of an array. Also, it is expected that duplicate arrays have similar percent 
 missing levels. &#160;</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="4"><a name="Scaling_Factors"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scaling Factors</span> &#160;As 
 part of the quality control procedure, intensities are normalized using 
 the MAS5 procedure. Within the process of normalization, each array is 
 adjusted by a scaling factor to get the trimmed mean of all arrays to 
 equal a target signal. This scaling factor indicates how much RNA was 
 hybridized onto the array. A wide variation of scaling factors across 
 arrays can be a cause for concern. Affymetrix defines a wide variation 
 as a three-fold or greater difference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Simpleaffy</span> package from 
 Bioconductor calculates the four within-array quality control check measures 
 from a group of CEL files and displays the results on a single QC Stats 
 graph:</p>
        <div class="MCDropDown">
            <div class="MCDropDownHead"><a class="MCDropDownHotSpot" href="javascript:void(0);" id="MCDropDownHotSpot_95744531_0" onclick="FMCDropDown( this ); return false;"><img style="border: none;margin-right: 5px;" src="SkinSupport/DropDownClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="SkinSupport/DropDownOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( 'SkinSupport/DropDownOpen.gif' ); }" class="MCDropDownIcon" />Take a look</a>
            </div>
            <div class="MCDropDownBody" id="MCDropDownBody_95744531_0" style="display: none;">
                <p>
                    <img src="Images/chip integrity 1.gif" style="width: 630px;height: 680px;border-left-style: Double;border-left-width: 4px;border-right-style: Double;border-right-width: 4px;border-top-style: Double;border-top-width: 4px;border-bottom-style: Double;border-bottom-width: 4px;border-left-color: #c0c0c0;border-right-color: #c0c0c0;border-top-color: #c0c0c0;border-bottom-color: #c0c0c0;float: none;" width="630" height="680" border="4" />
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Along the left side of the graph are the names of the CEL files that 
 were included in this analysis. The next column has two numbers per CEL 
 file. The top number is the <span style="font-style: italic;">percent 
 present</span> and the bottom number is the <span style="font-style: italic;">average 
 background</span> for that CEL file. It is expected that the <span style="font-style: italic;">average 
 background</span> measures across arrays should be similar and, ideally, 
 below 100. </p>
        <p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">percent present</span> values 
 are heavily dependent on the type of sample used on the array. If the 
 same type of tissue is used in all samples, the percent present values 
 should be similar across arrays. However, if you have multiple tissue 
 types such as liver and brain, the percent present values could vary substantially 
 between these tissues.</p>
        <p>When the <span style="font-style: italic;">average background</span> 
 measures display in red, it indicates that the values across arrays show 
 a "considerable amount of variation". When the <span style="font-style: italic;">percent 
 present</span> values display in red, it indicates that there is a spread 
 greater than 10% between the lowest and highest percentage. &#160;</p>
        <p>The solid dots that are attached to a horizontal bar originating from 
 the zero line represent the <span style="font-style: italic;">scale factors</span> 
 (indicators of how much RNA was hybridized to the array) for each array. 
 The blue shading is the region that spans three-fold below and three-fold 
 above the average <span style="font-style: italic;">scale factor</span>. 
 In the graph above, all of the <span style="font-style: italic;">scale 
 factors</span> fall into this range. However, if one scale factor did 
 not fall within the range, the dot and horizontal line for that scale 
 factor would display in red.</p>
        <p>The intensity of the two <span style="font-style: italic;">internal 
 control</span> housekeeping genes is represented by open triangles and 
 open diamonds and measures the quality of the hybridized RNA.</p>
        <p>The open triangles represent the log base 2 of the 3' to 5' ratio for 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">β-actin</span>. In the graph above, 
 a value of 0 for the ratio would be ideal and a value above 1.6 would 
 be a cause for concern. None of the ratios in the graph are greater than 
 1.6.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the open diamonds on the graph represent the log base 2 of 
 the 3' to 5' ratio of <span style="font-style: italic;">GAPDH</span>. 
 This ratio should be below 0.32. Again, none of the ratios are above the 
 threshold.</p>
