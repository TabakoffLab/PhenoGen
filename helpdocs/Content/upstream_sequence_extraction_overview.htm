        <h1><a name="kanchor135"></a>Upstream Sequence Extraction Overview</h1>
        <p>An important step in understanding the mechanisms that regulate the 
 expression of genes is represented by the ability to identify regulatory 
 elements, i.e., the binding sites in DNA for transcription factors. Transcription 
 factors are DNA binding proteins, typically upstream from, and close to, 
 the transcription start site (TSS) 
 of a gene, that modulate the expression of the gene by activating or repressing 
 the transcription machinery. </p>
        <p>Because there is a limited amount of information regarding the majority 
 of the transcription factors and especially about their target binding 
 sites (even in well-characterized organisms) you could focus on computational 
 tools designed for the discovery of novel regulatory elements, where nothing 
 is known <span style="font-size: 9pt;">a priori </span>of the transcription 
 factor or its preferred binding sites. If you provide a collection of 
 sequences that correspond to the regulatory regions of genes that are 
 believed to be co-regulated, the computational tool identifies short DNA 
 sequence 'motifs' that are statistically over- or under-represented in 
 these regulatory regions. Accurate identification of these motifs is very 
 difficult because they are short signals (typically about 10 bp long) 
 in the midst of a great amount of statistical noise (a typical input being 
 one regulatory region of length 1,000 bp upstream of each gene). Also, 
 there is marked sequence variability among the consensus binding sites 
 of a given transcription factor, and the nature of the variability itself 
 is not well understood.</p>
        <p>There are numerous tools available for this task of motif prediction. 
 They differ from each other mainly in their definition of what represents 
 a motif and what would be an acceptable model for statistical over-representation 
 of a motif. A comprehensive list of tools that could be used (table adapted 
 from Tompa 
 et al, 2005, Nature 23(1):137-144) is presented in the <a href="Supplementary_Information.htm" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Online">Supplementary 
 Information</a>. 
 This sequence information can be used to carry out TFBS 
 analysis, off the PhenoGen website, using any of these tools. </p>
