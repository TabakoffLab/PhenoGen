        <h1>You can reduce the number of genes in your list by their physical location 
 or the location of their eQTL? </h1>
        <p>You can eliminate some of the genes on your gene list that are not physically 
 located in specific user-defined regions (e.g., pQTL regions; see <a href="Entering_Phenotypic_QTLs.htm">Entering 
 Phenotypic QTLs</a> to set up these regions). </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered" value="1">Access the chromosomal 
 map view of your genes and user-defined regions from the <a href="Viewing_Location_and_eQTL.htm">Location 
 tab</a> of the Research Genes tab. </li>
            <li class="Numbered" value="2">Choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced 
 Settings</span>, select your region of interest, then choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical 
 location within region</span> in the Configure Graphic by Region of Interest 
 section. The gene list you download from this selection is limited to 
 those genes in the physical location of your region of interest.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Another way to eliminate some of the genes in your gene list is to exclude 
 the eQTLs (green markers on chromosomal map) that do not lie in the region 
 of interest. </p>

            <li class="Numbered" value="2">Choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show
