        <h1><a name="kanchor144"></a>MIAME Overview</h1>
        <p>MIAME (Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment) is a standard 
 for exchanging microarray experimental data in such a way as to make it 
 easily interpreted and allow for easy and independent verification. It 
 is described in the abstract of the original MIAME proposal [1] as follows: 
 &#160;</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 1in;margin-right: 1.5in;"><span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-size: 9pt;">Microarray 
 analysis has become a widely used tool for the generation of gene expression 
 data on a genomic scale. Although many significant results have been derived 
 from microarray studies, one limitation has been the lack of standards 
 for presenting and exchanging such data. Here we present a proposal, the 
 Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME), that describes 
 the minimum information required to ensure that microarray data can be 
 easily interpreted and that results derived from its analysis can be independently 
 verified. The ultimate goal of this work is to establish a standard for 
 recording and reporting microarray-based gene expression data, which will 
 in turn facilitate the establishment of databases and public repositories 
 and enable the development of data analysis tools. With respect to MIAME, 
 we concentrate on defining the content and structure of the necessary 
 information rather than the technical format for capturing it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Thus MIAME compliance provides the minimum information required to interpret 
 unambiguously and potentially reproduce and verify an array-based gene 
 expression monitoring experiment. Although details for particular experiments 
 may be different, MIAME aims to define the core that is common to most 
 experiments. MIAME is not a formal specification, but a set of guidelines. 
 </p>
        <p>One of the major objectives of MIAME is to guide the development of 
 microarray databases and data management software. A standard microarray 
 data model and exchange format MAGE [2], which is able to capture information 
 specified by MIAME, has been submitted by EBI (for MGED) and Rosetta Biosoftware, 
 and recently became an Adopted Specification of the OMG standards group. 
 Many organizations, including Agilent, Affymetrix, and Iobion, 
 have contributed ideas to MAGE. &#160;</p>
        <p>Although MIAME concentrates on the content of the information and should 
 not be confused with a data format, it also tries to provide a conceptual 
 structure for microarray experiment descriptions [3]. </p>
        <p>It is therefore of crucial importance that all users of the PhenoGen 
 site closely conform to these guidelines. To ensure this, the website 
 is structured in such a way that very little room is given for non-conformity.
