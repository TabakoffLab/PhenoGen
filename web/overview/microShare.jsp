                        You have two options for your data when you upload array files.  You can either choose to make them public or private.
                        <ul>
                        
                        	<li>Public arrays allow any PhenoGen user to copy the original array file and use it in their dataset.</li>
                            
                            <li>Private arrays will show up in search results, but users have to request access to the arrays at which point you will be notified and can login to either allow or deny the request.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>
