<H3>UCSC Genome Browser Image</H3>
The image displayed below is generated by the UCSC Genome Browser with a mix of data aggregated from PhenoGen, UCSC Genome Browser, and Ensembl.  Here is a quick primer if you are unfamiliar with the UCSC Genome Browser ?????.

You may add tracks using the controls below.  All of the tracks are color coded based on their source and track or on the data itself.  Please see detailed descriptions of each track below for further details on the color codeing and data contained in each track.

<H3>UCSC Image Controls</H3>
The controls above the UCSC image allow you to modify the information displayed in the image.<BR /><BR />
<ol style="padding-left:25px; list-style-type:upper-alpha;">
<li> The first control toggles the transcript data track, which contains Ensembl transcripts(Brown: IDs begin with ENS) and in rat also contains reconstructed transcripts from RNA-Seq of Whole Brain( Blue: multi-exon transcripts, Black: single exon transcripts, IDs begin with the tissue they are from, followed by a unique gene ID)<BR />
	<p>RNA-Seq Transcriptome Information<BR>
		Transcripts were reconstructed from sequencing BN-Lx and SHRH parental strains using CuffLinks software. The raw read data is available for download in the Downloads section under RNA Sequencing BED/SAM Data Files.</p><BR />
</li>
<li> The second control selects the track displayed on the lower part of the image.  There are three options:<BR />
	<ol style="padding-left:35px; list-style-type:decimal;">
    <li> None, which hides all the lower tracks.</li>
	<li> UCSC/Affymetrix Tissue Expression Data, which displays the Affy Exon tissue data provided by UCSC and Affymetrix.</li>
	<li> Human Chromosome/Protein Mappings, which displays the general regions of the current organism that map to a chromosome in the human genome based on the chromosome color key below the image. In mouse, the lower track includes homologous proteins in Humans.</li>
    </ul>
